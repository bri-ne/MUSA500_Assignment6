# Welcome!

This single-page website demos how to display visualizations created with altair, hvplot, and folium.

For examples of how to use markdown to style text, see this [this page](./another-page.html).

# Example: Embedding Altair & Hvplot Charts

This section will show examples of embedding interactive charts produced using [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) and [Hvplot](https://hvplot.pyviz.org/).

## Altair Example

Below is a chart of the incidence of measles since 1928 for the 50 US states.

<div id="altair-chart-1"></div>

This was produced using Altair and embedded in this static web page. Note that you can also display Python code on this page:

```python
import altair as alt
alt.renderers.enable('notebook')
```

## HvPlot Example

Lastly, the measles incidence produced using the HvPlot package:

<div id="hv-chart-1"></div>

## Notes

- See the [lecture 13A slides](https://musa-550-fall-2021.github.io/slideslecture-13A.html) for the code that produced these plots.

**Important: When embedding charts, you will likely need to adjust the width/height of the charts before embedding them in the page so they fit nicely when embedded.**

# Example: Embedding Folium charts

This post will show examples of embedding interactive maps produced using [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium).

## OSMnx and Street Networks

The shortest route between the Art Museum and the Liberty Bell:

<div id="folium-chart-1"></div>

<br/>

## Percentage of Households without Internet

The percentage of households without internet by county:

<div id="folium-chart-2"></div>

See the [lecture 9B slides](https://musa-550-fall-2021.github.io/slides/lecture-9B.html) and the [lecture 10A slides](https://musa-550-fall-2021.github.io/slides/lecture-10A.html) for the code that produced these plots.
