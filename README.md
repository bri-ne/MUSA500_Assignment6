  <li>Adapt the code provided for the class examples to do the following:</li>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
      <li>Extract the most recent (at most) 10,000 tweets that contain that search term/hashtag</li>
      <li>Clean the tweets (i.e., remove stop words, numbers, suffixes, etc.)</li>
      <li>Create a word cloud of the terms in the tweets</li>
      <li>Map the tweets</li>

## Search Term: “EVICTION”

In August of this year, the supreme court ended the federal eviction moratorium established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) nearly a year prior. While the moratorium was in place, Eviction Lab estimated that the US saw at least 1.55 million fewer eviction filings that normal.[^1] The moratorium was a crucial security measure for millions of Americans facing economic uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic. Philadelphia pioneered the widely successful Eviction Diversion Program using the federal COVID-19 relief packages passed by Congress, which began on September 1st, 2020. This program facilitated a mandated mediation process between landlord and tenant to reach an agreement before an eviction could be legally filed. “Before the pandemic, Philadelphia Averaged 20,000 evictions per year – fourth in total filings among the largest U.S. cities. Now, Philadelphia Municipal Court sees far fewer – just 5,000 this year to date.” 2 Similarly to the federal eviction moratorium, the Eviction Diversion Program was a safety net for low income Philadelphians at the local level. Without such programs, cost burdened renters across America are at the mercy of their landlords, and are a few missed rent payments away from homelessness.
